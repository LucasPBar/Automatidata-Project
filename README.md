# ðŸ—½ NYC Taxi Fare Prediction â€“ Automatidata Project

This project was developed as part of the Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate, with each phase completed at the end of its respective course.

In collaboration with Automatidata and the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), the goal was to build a regression-based predictive model capable of estimating taxi fare amounts before a ride begins. Using historical trip data, the model incorporates variables such as pickup and drop-off locations, time of day, distance, and service type to generate accurate fare predictions.

The initiative aims to:

Enhance transparency for passengers

Support smarter regulation of urban transportation

Provide strategic insights for future decision-making

This project showcases the application of data science to real-world urban mobility challenges and reflects a commitment to ethical, impactful analytics.
